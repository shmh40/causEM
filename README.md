# causEM
A package to emulate climate models with causal models.

Causal modelling provides a promising approach to robust emulation of climate models, allowing the quantification of the effect of intervening on variables in the climate model, such as emissions.

causEM provides a framework to build causal emulators of climate models, allowing computationally cheap prediction and quantification of the effect of interventions in the climate model.
